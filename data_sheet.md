# Datasheet 

## Motivation

- The dataset was created for the purpose of understanding the correlation between various health and personal attributes and the presence of heart disease.
- The dataset was created by a team of researchers and is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Composition

- The dataset represents individual patients and includes attributes like age, sex, cholesterol level, etc.
- There are 303 instances and 14 attributes, including the target variable indicating the presence and stage of heart disease.
- There are missing values in some attributes which have been handled using mean imputation.
- The dataset does not contain any confidential data as all personally identifiable information has been removed.

## Collection Process

- The data consists of various health metrics and personal information of patients collected from several hospitals.
- It's a compilation of data from various studies and not sampled from a larger dataset.
- The timeframe of data collection is not specified.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

- The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values using mean imputation.
- The “raw” data was not preserved; only preprocessed data was utilized for the model.

## Uses

- The dataset is primarily used for binary classification tasks to determine the presence or absence of heart disease.
- Users should be aware of the limitations due to the dataset size and should consider supplementing it with additional data for more accurate results.
- There are no specific tasks for which the dataset should not be used, but users should be cautious about its limitations.

## Distribution

- The dataset is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- It is not subject to any copyright or IP license but should be cited appropriately when used in research or other projects.

## Maintenance

- The dataset is maintained by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is not regularly updated or expanded.

## Reflection

- The utilization of this dataset for heart disease prediction aligns with the growing trend of AI and ML applications in healthcare. It underscores the value of data in deriving insights, improving patient care, and enhancing healthcare service delivery. Professionals and researchers can leverage such datasets to develop models that can transform traditional healthcare paradigms into more personalized, efficient, and effective systems.
