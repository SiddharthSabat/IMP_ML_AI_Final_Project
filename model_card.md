# Model Card

## Model Description

**Input:** The model takes a dataset consisting of 13 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other health metrics.
 
**Output:** The model predicts whether a patient has heart disease, with the output being binary: 0 for no presence of heart disease and 1 for the presence of heart disease.

**Model Architecture:** We employed a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees.

## Performance
The model achieved an accuracy of 91.8% on the test data. It demonstrated high precision and recall, indicating its effectiveness in identifying patients with and without heart disease. Here are the performance metrics

## Limitations
The model is trained on a limited dataset of 303 instances, which may not be representative of the broader population. It might not perform as effectively on diverse or significantly larger datasets.

## Trade-offs
The model achieves a balance between precision and recall but could potentially be improved with a larger and more diverse dataset, advanced feature engineering, and exploration of more complex models.


## Optimization

This model is optimized using Bayesian Optimization, a technique that is highly efficient in optimizing hyperparameters, especially in situations where evaluations are expensive, like in healthcare where each decision can significantly affect a patient's life. This ensures that the model delivers the most accurate and reliable results, essential for real-life applications.

## Reflection

This project reflects the profound impact that AI and ML can have on healthcare, showcasing the potential for enhanced diagnostics, treatment personalization, and improved patient outcomes. It emphasizes the need for aspiring and current professionals to hone their skills in these technologies to contribute innovatively to healthcare advancements.
